A Archipelago multi-world rando mod for System Shock 2.  Created with lots of help from RoSoDude and Sarge945.  Not playable yet.
List of items and their properties needs to be made, and the list of locations and monsters on levels needs to be built.  Along with other changes that need to be made to maps.
