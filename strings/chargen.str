Mission9:"Where am I?
You wake up on a ship feeling very weak, somebody is yelling at you but they seem unintelligible and confused.  A collection of shapes near you dancing around catches your attention.  After trying to touch them reality tears apart for a moment as the shapes are pulled into the tear.  Another tear appears tossing nanites at your head making you feel even worse.  You have a feeling other people are relying on you so you get up and start your adventure.
You gain nothing, puny human."
